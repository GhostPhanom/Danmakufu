Place the contained folder in your [Danmakufu directory]/script folder.

Lasers are controlled in "/system/rb_Game_curvylasers.dnh" and "/system/rb_Game_gfx_laser.dnh"
My shot sheet and shot data are also specific to them, but can easily be adapted by editing the graphics rect coordinates in "rb_Game_gfx_laser.dnh".

Music goes in system/snd/st1b.ogg
